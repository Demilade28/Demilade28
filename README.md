I’m a **third-year cybersecurity student** on a journey to earn my **Security+** and **Network+**.  
Along the way, I’m building hands-on projects, experimenting in labs, and having fun breaking (and fixing) things in the name of security. 🚀

## 🎯 Objective
To learn, break, fix, and share.  
This portfolio is my sandbox where I test ideas, build security projects, and show the fun side of becoming a cybersecurity professional. 🚀
