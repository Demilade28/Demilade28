Learning Path: SOC Level 1
What I Learned
This module broke down the three main tools that keep a SOC running: SIEM, EDR, and SOAR. Before this, I knew these were "important security tools," but now I actually understand what each one does and why SOCs can't function without them.
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is basically the brain of the SOC. It collects logs from everything—firewalls, servers, endpoints—and helps analysts spot suspicious patterns. Think of it as a massive search engine for security events.
EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) focuses on individual devices. It monitors what's happening on laptops, servers, and workstations in real-time, which is crucial because most attacks target endpoints first.
SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is the efficiency tool. It automates repetitive tasks like enriching alerts or blocking malicious IPs, so analysts can focus on actual threats instead of clicking through the same steps 50 times a day.
Why This Matters
Understanding these tools isn't just about knowing definitions—it's about knowing how they work together. SIEM detects the anomaly, EDR investigates the endpoint, and SOAR handles the grunt work. That's the workflow of a real SOC.
This module gave me a solid foundation for the hands-on labs coming up. Now when I see "investigate this alert in Splunk" or "configure an EDR rule," I'll actually know what I'm doing.
